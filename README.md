# Plaintext Article
A simple python script I use for reading articles in plain text.

It depends on [txtify.it](https://txtify.it), and is intended for moderate use (for too many requests you should use their API).

## Usage
Print article on screen
```
$ python plaintext_article.py https://articles.xyz/some-article
```
Print article on screen and save it as an `.md` file.
```
$ python plaintext_article.py https://articles.xyz/some-article -s
```
