# Plaintext Article
A simple python script I use for reading articles in plain text.

It depends on [txtify.it](https://txtify.it), and is intended for moderate use (for too many requests you should use their API).

## Usage
Print article to the screen
```
$ python plaintext_article.py https://articles.xyz/some-article
```
Print article to the screen and write it to a `.txt` file
```
$ python plaintext_article.py https://articles.xyz/some-article -s
```
